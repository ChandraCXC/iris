        <h2><a name="Adjusting_the_coordinates_view_port"></a><a name="wcsviewport"></a> Adjusting the view port</h2>
        <p>The set of widgets in the upper-left corner of the data display are available for adjusting the view and orientation of the SED segment(s) within the main display.</p>

        <h3>Zooming in and out</h3>
        <p>There are a few methods of zooming and out of the view port:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Zoom in/out from the center of the viewport by clicking the 
                <img src="" alt="[Zoom in/out buttons]"/> buttons at the top of 
                the Plotter.
            </li>
            <li>
                Zoom in/out from the cursor's position by hovering over the 
                view port scrolling up or down.
            </li>
            <li>
                Expand or contract either the X or Y axis by hovering over the 
                outside of the graph and scrolling up (to expand) or down (to 
                contract). The cursor's position is the reference position for 
                expanding/contracting the axis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hold Shift and click-and-drag the box to zoom into a specific 
                region on the view port.
            </li>
            <li>
                Right-click and drag the mouse over the plot to expand/contract 
                the view port along both the X and Y axes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Panning</h3>
        <p>There are two methods for panning around the view port:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Left-click and drag the plot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the four (4) arrow buttons at the top of the plot window 
                <img src="" alt="[Panning buttons]"/> to
                pan the view port up, down, left, and right.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Change the plot scaling</h3>
        <p>
            The X and Y axes can be plotted in linear or logarithmic scales. The 
            user controls the scaling by clicking <em>View --> Plot Type --> 
            </em> then choosing the scaling:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Log</b> - plot both X and Y in a logarithmic scale.</li>
            <li><b>Linear</b> - plot both X and Y in a linear scale.</li>
            <li><b>X Log</b> - plot X in a logarithmic scale, and Y linearly.</li>
            <li><b>Y Log</b> - plot Y in a logarithmic scale, and X linearly.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Grid lines on/off</h3>
        <p>
            Toggle the grid lines on and off through <em>View --> Grid on/off</em>.
            By default, grid lines are turned on.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Reseting the plot view</h3>
        <p>
            Click the Reset button <img src="" alt="[Reset button]"/> to reset 
            the view port to the full range of the SED. All <b>unmasked</b> data 
            points will be shown on the plot.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Fixing the plot view</h3>
        <p>
            By default, if any SED changes occur (adding/removing a SED segment, 
            switching SEDs, etc.), the plot ranges will be reset to show every 
            data point in the SED. By fixing the plot, any SED events that 
            happen outside of the Visualizer will not affect the view port 
            plot ranges. The user can still pan, zoom in/out, and reset the 
            plot ranges manually, but the plot view will remain unaffected by 
            SED changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            To fix the view port, click <em>View --> Fixed</em>. You can toggle 
            the behavior on and off.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Changing the plot units</h3>
        <p>
            The plot units can be changed through the Units Manager window, 
            which is opened from clicking <img src="" alt="[Units button]"/>. 
            Choose from the list of provided units, then click "Update" to 
            change the units on the plot. This will also update the units 
            shown in the Data tab of the Metadata Browser.
        </p>
